## Create objects without registration


</div>

### Description

This is not my code it is a code made by [rm_code] and for what ever reason his account no longer exists and this great code was deleted. I was searching using google trying to find this code but found with the google cache that it was the right one but was no longer on psc, I then searched all over my computer and found it!

I have included the google cache of the page so you can see some peoples comments, questions, and the answers.

This code will allow you to create objects without registering the dll or ocx first!

You simply call CreateObjectFromFile and the code will turn it into an object. Here is the original definition:

"This is a handy module which allows you to create an object from an Active-X server (OCX, DLL) without the need to register it first. &gt;&gt; Updated: removed Prog ID check because it required the object to be registered... changed Prog ID check to Class ID check, so you'll need the class name now. To get it, use a type library viewer of your choice or my type library browser submission."

I will not be able to help as much if you have questions seeing as I did not write the code, but check the questions already given inside the google cache included and if you still dont know the answer feel free to ask me and I will try to help. Enjoy!
